Here are some cool animations of common sorting algorithms. Although the animation of some don't reflect the actual sorting process (e.g. HeapSort) all sorting algorithms have been implemented from scratch and animted using matplotlib. Clone the repository, make sure sort.py is in the same directory as any specific sorting implementation (e.g. quick.py -> quicksort) and run file!

Feel free to mess with the speed, number of samples, etc.
